<h5 align="center">Coffee obsessive turned TDD and clean code enthusiast.</h5>

Hello im Katie, a full stack junior developer, looking for opportunities in the productivity tools and tech consulting space. My mission is to design and implement clever solutions that elevate a company's productivity.

After 7 years fixing coffee machines, teaching classes and slinging lattes, I am ready to fuel productivity with clever code instead of caffeine, currently based in London, but would consider moving anywhere with good surf. :surfer:

<h2 align="center" >I am</h2>

### A Problem Solver

From fixing coffee machines to guiding customers in a training class, I can think on my feet, approaching problems with a methodical and inquisitive and mindset alloweing me to keep my cool whilst making a solid plan to solve it.
At Makers I continued to hone this skill,  using techniques to tighten the loop to find bugs and breaking down a seemingly impossible problem into manageable chunks.


### A Great Collaborator

I understand Teamwork and open communication is vital in all team settings, whether it’s actively listening and following others expectations and ideas, or putting my own forward in a new team setting, I can effectively contribute to team goals as well as helping theirs others stay on track.
This transferred to programming, pushing for an agile approach to workflow, allowed me to harmoniously collaborate within a group/pair setting, It also helped me Mentor a student from a later cohort, offering guidance and support as they needed it throughout their journey.

### A Fast Learner 

I learn and apply new concepts quickly and effectively, by understanding my blind spots in a new situation, knowing when to ask for help, and understanding how I learn most effectively.
After being promoted at Allpress to Retail Manager/Coffee Trainer, after having relatively little experience training I  created and lead coffee classes,  transferred this into a formula we rolled out at events and festivals around the UK, both by myself and training others to lead these classes.
